Introducing a new PHP micro-framework: Bullet. Bullet is a resource-oriented
micro PHP framework built around HTTP URIs. Bullet takes a unique functional-
style approach to URL routing by parsing each path part independently and one
at a time using nested closures. The path part callbacks are nested to produce
different responses and to follow and execute deeper paths as paths and
parameters are matched.

Bullet makes it easier than ever to build REST APIs and other applications in PHP
in a simple, concise, and straightforward manner with almost no learning curve
and nearly unlimited flexibility.
