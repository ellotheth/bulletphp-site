## Param Callbacks

Param callbacks allow you to respond to and capture path segments that match
specific patterns or contain specific characters. Param callbacks are named 
patterns with matcher callbacks like `int` that only matches integers.

### Built-In Param Callback Types

There are several built-in callback types that cover the most common URI
segment patterns that you will want to respond with. These types are:

 * `int` - Matches integers and numbers
 * `float` - Matches floating point numbers
 * `boolean` - Matches "1", "true", "on", and "yes" (based on
   `FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN`)
 * `slug` - Matches alphanumeric URL pattern with underscores and dashes
   (`[a-zA-Z0-9-_]`)
 * `email` - Matches valid email addresses using `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL`

This example uses the `slug` param matcher to match only URL slugs. This will
match URIs like `/posts/my-post-title` and will output `Post: my-post-title`.

{% geshi 'php' %}
$app->path('posts', function($request) use($app) {
    $app->param('slug', function($request, $postId) use($app) {
        return "Post: " . $postId;
    });
});
{% endgeshi %}

<div class="alert alert-info">
  The `param` method path callback will have a second argument that holds
  the matched URI segment or other returned value (`$postId` in this example).
</div>

### Register a Custom Type

If you need to register your own custom param type, it's as simple as one
method call with a custom name and a callback that runs the validation.

This is the callback that Bullet uses for `int` paths:

{% geshi 'php' %}
$app->registerParamType('int', function($value) {
    return filter_var($value, FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);
});
{% endgeshi %}

### Matching Rules

If the param callback returns boolean `true`, the attached path callback will
be executed and the original URI segment will be passed to the attached path
callback.

If the param callback returns any value (anything other than boolean `false`),
the attached callback will be executed, and the returned value will be passed
to the path callback. This is useful if you want to modify the URI segment
before it gets passed to the attached path callback.

If the param callback returns boolean `false` (no match), the attached path
callback will be skipped and never executed.
