title: Events - Intercepting Requests and Injecting Responses
---

## Events

Events in Bullet allow you to intercept and modify requests before they hit your
application, and alter responses after your application sends them, but before
they are sent to the browser or user. Events can be used anytime you need to
apply a global behavior to your application when it meets certain conditions.

Events can be useful for injecting custom responses on specific status codes,
like serving a custom "File Not Found" page every time a `404` HTTP status is
sent by your application. They can also be used for things like decoding a
request body a custom way or performing user authentication checks if a cookie
or HTTP Auth headers are present.

### Named Events

Fixed event names that are always fired in a bullet request/response cycle.

 * `before` - Before any route handler is matched or executed
 * `after` - After the last route handler is executed and the response is ready to be sent

### Dynamic Events

Dynamic events are dependent upon the response being sent from your
application, and are fired just before the `after` event.

 * `[http_status_code]` - Like `404`, or `500`, etc.
 * `[response_format]` - Like `html`, `json`, `xml`, etc.
 * `[exception_class]` - Exception class name like `InvalidArgumentException`. Every
exception also triggers the base `Exception` event that you can use to handle all
exceptions, and set the HTTP response status to `500` by default.

## Specific Examples

Here are a few examples to get you started with event handling:

### Serving Custom 404 Pages

This example injects the contents of a custom `errors/404` template into the response
every time the application sends a 404 error.

{% geshi 'php' %}
$app->on(404, function(\Bullet\Request $request, \Bullet\Response $response) use($app) {
    $response->content($app->template('errors/404')->content());
});
{% endgeshi %}

This example uses [templates](/docs/templates) and may require some configuration.

### Capture and log Exceptions

Exceptions are unique to other events because instead of only a request and response
object getting passed, a third argument is passed - the Exception object. This example
displays Exceptions in a nice format, and logs them to [Sentry](http://getsentry.com) when in production.

{% geshi 'php' %}
// Display exceptions with error and 500 status
$app->on('Exception', function(\Bullet\Request $request, \Bullet\Response $response, \Exception $e) use($app, $raven) {
    if($request->format() === 'json') {
        $response->content(array(
            'exception' => get_class($e),
            'message' => $e->getMessage()
        ));
    } else {
        $response->content($app->template('errors/exception', array('e' => $e))->content());
    }

    if(BULLET_ENV == 'production') {
        // Log Exception to Sentry
        $raven->captureException($e);
    }
});
{% endgeshi %}
