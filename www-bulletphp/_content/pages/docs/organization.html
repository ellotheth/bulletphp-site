## Project Organization and Setup

Organizing an application using a micro-framework like Bullet can sometimes be
a challenge because there is no pre-determined or enforced structure like there
is with larger frameworks. This gives you a lot more freedom and control, but it
also comes with questions about where to put certain things like configuration,
templates, models, etc. and the best way to organize larger projects to maintain
a good separation of concerns.

This page is offered as the recommended
way to setup and organize an application built on Bullet so everyone on your team
stays sane - even if that just means you.

## Folder Organization

Typically, it is desireable to setup your project with a few different top-level
directories that contain your different main content types. An example might be:

 * `assets` - All your frontend asset files like images, CSS, and javascript
    * `images` - Image files
    * `scripts` - JavaScript files
    * `styles` - CSS/Stylesheets
 * `lib` - Any custom libraries created specifically for this project
 * `src` - All route files and anything related to this application
    * `lang` - Language files, if using I18N
    * `templates` - Template files
    * `routes` - Route files
 * `test` - Tests for this application (any type)
 * `vendor` - Composer-create folder with Bullet and dependencies

## Route Organization

The easiest way to organize your project is to separate all the router handlers
for different base routes like `posts`, `events`, and `comments` into different
same-named files, like `posts.php`, `events.php`, and `comments.php`. This is
very similar to the way you would separate and organize your code in a larger
MVC framework with controller classes. If you are following the folder structure
above, these would be placed in `src/routes`.
