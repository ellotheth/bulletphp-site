## Views, Templates, and Layouts

Bullet comes with full PHP template support that can be used to render basic
PHP files as templates with some nice enhancements and features bundled in.

## Configuring Templates

Before Bullet can know how to render your templates, you have to let Bullet
know where they are. If you want to use layouts, Bullet has to know where those
are too. Template support can be configured with a simple array when creating
the main `Bullet\App` object:

{% geshi 'php' %}
$app = new Bullet\App(array(
    'template.cfg' => array(
        'path' => __DIR__ . '/templates/',
        'path_layouts' => __DIR__ . '/templates/layout/',
        'auto_layout' => 'application'
    )
));
{% endgeshi %}

The `auto_layout` flag, if set to a string, will automatically wrap all templates
in a layout file of the same name if no other layout is specified. So in this
example, a layout file would have to exist at `src/templates/layout/application.html.php`.
If you don't want this behavior, set the flag to boolean `false` or simply remove
it (it is off by default).

## Responding With Templates From Routes

Bullet has a built-in helper method `template` for rendering templates as HTTP
responses from routes:

{% geshi 'php' %}
$app->path('/', function($request) use($app) {
    return $app->template('hello', array('name' => 'World'));
});
{% endgeshi %}

Note that you are using `return` instead of `echo` or `print`. This is an important
feature of Bullet. Every route should respond with a valid response type, and
the `Bullet\View\Template` object is actually a valid HTTP response that knows
how to render itself on-demand. This means that you are returning a template
object, and not a rendered chunk of content. This allows you to further
manipulate the response and alter it in [events](/docs/events) and nested
[sub-requests](/docs/sub-requests), even after this route is matched and executed.

## Full-Featured Example

Here is a more full-featured example of template usage, just so you can see all
the options that are available to you. The `header` and `status` methods come
from the `Bullet\Request` object that the template object extends (a template
is literally a form of an HTTP response in Bullet).

{% geshi 'php' %}
$app->path('/', function($request) use($app) {
    return $app->template('hello')
        ->set(array('name' => 'World'))
        ->layout('auth')
        ->format('xml') // makes it xml.php instead of html.php
        ->header('Content-Type', 'text/xml')
        ->status(200);
});
{% endgeshi %}
