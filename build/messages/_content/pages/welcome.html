title: Welcome To Your New Website
---

It looks like you have a fresh install of **PieCrust**. Thanks for downloading
it and trying it out! You're almost ready to start writing your own stuff:

* Create a `_content` directory at the root of your website (probably next to the 
  `_piecrust` directory).
* Inside it, create the following:
	* A `config.yml` text file (this will contain your website's global settings, like its title).
	* A `templates` directory (this will contain things like HTML layouts).
	* A `pages` directory (this will contain the contents of your pages).
* Create a default template, appropriately called `default.html`. Use the
  {% raw %}`{{content|raw}}`{% endraw %} tag to indicate where the page contents
  should go.
* Create your main page, called `_index.html` and put whatever you want in it.
* Refresh your browser!
